# Project: Getting your feet wet

This repo is following the requirements for Chapter 2 of The Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl.
This is one of the assignments of the `Getting Your Feet Wet` Project on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/getting-your-feet-wet#assignment)

So far this is a page with no styling at all. No css was coded for this project so far, maybe in a future release I'll do that? Maybe not? Let's see.

Clone this project and test it for yourself.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

If you encounter any problems, let me know, I'll be more than happy to help.
